# odin-landing-page

<<<<<<< HEAD
The main focus of this project was to practise using flexbox as well as reinforcing html and css techniques.

More specifically, the aim was to use flexbox to arrange and align items in to the desired landing page layout.

One aspect of this project I found somewhat challenging was the quote section. I had to keep the quote text centered on the page while having the author underneath and aligned to the right but still following the text above.

I ended up setting a width property to both the quote text and author which solved this problem.
